  <p class="lead">Welcome to my portfolio site..</p>
  <p>
    <h4>What you can see here</h4>
	
	I'm currently updating this portfolio with the past 3 years' doings.<br /><br /> 
	
    This site serves as an on-line CV of sorts. It showcases some of the projects I've
    worked on over the years, with the newest stuff being from my MSc Computer Games
    and Entertainment course with Goldsmiths. It demonstrates (to some degree) my
    caliber as a Software Engineer and the technologies I am familiar with. Where I
    saw fit, I also included links to code repositories where you can see actual
    source code I've produced.
    <br /><br />
    I'll be adding projects to the portfolio section over time as they are completed
    and when time allows. I don't go into much detail here, but if there are any
    projects you would like to discuss, let's talk.
    <br /><br />
    I also ramble on about myself a bit, so you can get an idea of my background and
    aims.
    <br /><br />

    <h4>What is it?</h4>
    I built the site from scratch using
    <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Bootstrap</a> in about
    a week. It's lightweight (bar the torrent of small images) and all static
    content (HTML5 and JavaScript). The code for it can be found on my github
    account if you'd like to take a look:
    <a href="https://github.com/iqabsent/portfolio">https://github.com/iqabsent/portfolio</a>
    You're welcome to use any of it if you so desire; please share with me any bugs
    or anomalies you find (if you're on a mobile device, flip the thing sideways for
    menu at <a href="#top">the top</a>).
    <br /><br />
    Feel free to browse. If you're after a copy of my actual CV, please contact me;
    I'd be happy to know who's looking :)
