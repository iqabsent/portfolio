      A big chunk of the MSc Computer Games and Entertainment course revolves
      around building a game engine and a first-slice game demo to show off its
      capabilities. This was a group excersise where we were to form two teams;
      the Engine Team and the Demo Team. We were free to roam and help achieve
      milestones on either or both as we saw fit. We each found our role; mine
      turned out to be script lead on the Demo Team, and later animation scripting
      on the Engine Team<br />
      While the Engine Team started assembling the "Gold Engine", the demo team
      took to Unity3D and started working on a game demo which would later be ported
      to the Gold Engine once it's ready. We started out with drawings and
      documents, and several (good) proposals for what exactly we were to develop.
      We ended up with a first-person "puzzler" game, like Portal without the
      portals and no portal gun. I believe the following has been agreed upon 100%:
      "You are in a place, and you're trying to get out. Go!"<br />
      We mocked up a single playable puzzle which makes use of lift-like
      platforms, metal crates and an electromagnet which the player can use to
      build a staircase up to .. the upper part .. of something.<br />

    <br />
    A lot of the heavy lifting is done by algorithms produced by the Mathemator.
    The majority of the remainder is based on work by <a target="_blank" href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/tudor-nita/4b/1b3/b48">Tudor Nita</a>
    I worked backwards from this, stripping it down to a point I could grasp all

    the same effect, in others, either Mathemator or Tudor's (well documented) code
    was hard to beat in simplicity and elegance.. so it was reused.

    This ws also my first integration with <a target="_blank" href="http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/">
    AntTweakBar</a>; it will not be the last.
    <br /><br />
    The simulation morphs a triangle mesh by adjusting the height values of
    vertices according to the average height value of 8 separate sine waves.
    Parameters for each wave can be adjusted (thanks, AntTweakBar) as can the
    colour values of the wave and speed of animation.
    <br /><br />
    For each frame, normals are recalculated and averaged (thanks, Tudor) and

      This was a bit of a nightmare .. I loved it.<br />
      The problem here wasn't the fluid simulation itself, but rather the limits of
      OpenGL ES 2.0 and GLSL v1.1 as supported by current iDevices.
      <br /><br />
      The idea was to take an existing fluid dynamic simulation, and port it to run
      on an iPhone/iPad. For this, we found some great work here <a target="_blank" href="http://prideout.net/blog/?p=58">http://prideout.net/blog/?p=58</a>
      and fell down the iOS rabbit hole to start our porting adventure.
      <br /><br />
      On this project, I had the opportunity to work with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=14781823">Per Griffiths</a>; we spent many
      hours looking at a small screen displaying a blue dot, and a very static white
      splat near the bottom.

    <div class="detail span12">
      Even though we managed to get 99% of the code ported to GLSL v1.1, compiling
      and running in an OpenGL ES 2.0 render loop on an iPad, there was one single
      GLSL v1.5+ function we were unable to find a suitable substitute for in GLSL
      v1.1.
      <br />
      Since we spent a lot of time on this, we kept at it for some time after the
      project deadline (and an akward final presentation) had come and gone.
      In the end, due to other demands on our time, we had to put our hands up and
      concede defeat. We were not able to achieve a working port. We do not,
      however, see this project as a failure. We were both content with the outcome
      in terms of how much we managed to learn. We both gained much knowledge of GLSL
      v1.1 and its limitations; unfortunately though, knowledge is invisible and doesn't
      display well as HTML5 markup either.. so I hope that future work will allow us
      to flex our GLSL

      This was a native iOS application, so UIKit was explored too, but barely used.

    The name, "AltitudeZero", is a play on fact that the game is written using 3D

    all game-objects to 0.

    We were given the assignment to produce either a demo showing integration with
    a middleware of our choosing (Box2D and Bullet being the most prominent options
    as these were covered during the course) or write a useful tool. I dug in for
    the latter.<br />
    <br />
    During lectures there was mention of "impostors" or "sprites" as I know them.
    These are still used today in games as a means of saving resources when drawing
    distant objects (instead of 3D models) where you can get away with low detail.
    I remembered rotating a QuakeII quad-damage model at 30 degree angle steps and
    making screen-shots to assemble them into an animated windows cursor, for
    personal use back in school, and thought a tool do do this kind of thing for
    you would be useful, thus: Impostorisor was born.<br />
    <br />
    The Tool takes as input a 3D model in .geom format (<a target="_blank" href="http://andythomason.com/">Andy Thomason</a>'s work) and
    spits out a single image with a grid of frames at stepped angle rotations of
    the input model against a black background.
    This project saw me step into the world of OpenGL (similar to DirectX, so not
    totally new) and re-acquainted with my good friend C++. It looked different after
    years of PHP and JavaScript.

    This delves into the use of agents within Google’s SketchUp, an entry level CAD
    package. It explores the extension of SketchUp functionality via the Ruby API.
    It seeks to allow users to turn components into intelligent objects, capable of
    reflecting user-defined personalities by means of distribution. It is a step
    towards having tables and chairs sort themselves into appropriate layouts,
    taking the mundane task of spatial distribution away from the architect. No
    agents were harmed during the development of this software.<br />
    <br />
    I hope to make the power of Agent available to the casual CAD user. The ideal
    outcome is to create a tool for Google SketchUp which allows the user to turn
    3D components into intelligent objects with relative ease. These objects
    should be capable of aligning, distancing and orientating themselves in
    relation to their peers according to behaviour sets specified by the user.
    The desired result is that these components can achieve a “good” distribution
    on their own.-

    During my first year of BSc study, I was given the opportunity to work on a
    small project for a company (then) based on campus at UEL. The inital project
    was simply a project management application, to manage files and links between
    them to ease the use of MicroStation, a CAD package in use by the architects in
    the studio. This then flowed over into development of Site Capacity, and an
    indefinite contract with them (which lasted 5 good years).<br />
    <br />
    Site Capacity is a tool used by the practice to aid in quick generation of
    urban layouts. I was fortunate enough to work on this with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=50908910">Renee Puusepp</a>.
    It involved programatic distribution of pre-created geometrical objects along
    user-defined paths. It also touched on Business Information Modeling (BIM),
    essentially just embedding meta-data into the geometry for better programatic
    management and evaluation of constructions.<br />
    <br />
    This project introduced me to agile development methods, extreme- and
    pair-programming. It was the first time I got to use an API to a 3D environment
    , and also the first time being paid to do coding.. happy.<br />

    At the very end of a 2-year course dealing purely with syntax and usage of
    several programming languages along with various database connectors, we were
    given the opportunity to write a database system .. or a 3D game. This second
    option would be wholly self-taught. We had, if memory serves, 5 weeks.<br />
    <br />
    The hardest part was the first two weeks' total lack of progress. It was an
    individual project; myself and one other candidate were the only ones to take
    up the challange. We combined research efforts until we found the DirectX SDK
    and the accompanying sample code as a starting point. He went FPS, I went
    flight-sim.<br />
    The end result was a 3D cube sky-box with a nice wrapping skyline and a
    textured floor (which tiles nicely, thanks 3D Studio Max) containing a .x model
    of an aircraft somewhere inside it. The craft position was fixed in x- and z-
    axes, but was free to move up and down on y. The illusion of movement is
    created by constantly adjusting the texture offset on the floor. Height is
    restricted by means of an engine-stall, and a crash at the bottom.<br />
    <br />
    This was my first encounter with 3D graphics. It also incorporates sound and
    UI elements. All sprites were created by myself using MS Paint.<br />
    I remember scratching my head about why 3.14 ("wait, that's pi!") rotated
    the reversed model to face the right direction, and not 180; first encounter
    with radians.

    With limited knowledge, and limited graphical capabilities, a game was
    written..<br />
    There was no internet access (I would only become acquainted with the WWW a
    year or so later); things were figured out. Knowledge of peers and teachers
    was drawn upon. Non-blocking key input (i.e., not readchar) was a key
    discovery (no pun intended). I also managed to figure out the logic of a game
    loop, years before I would learn the term.<br />
    <br />
    This was my first exploration of 2D coordinate space and collision detection.
    It was also my first attempt at AI. I learnt very quickly that a "perfect" AI
    was boring and frustrating.. that you had to build in flaws or randomness to
    make the game beatable.<br />
    I also learnt a bit about game dynamic here. The player who was "it" needed
    some advantage. Leaving the screen at one edge, saw the player enter from the
    edge opposite, pacman-style. This would allow for an infinite chase across
    screen-space, so the "it" player was made slightly faster.<br />
    Land-mines were also added .. the running player could place a pixel of its
    own colour at the press of a button. If the chasing player hit it, he would
    be spawned again at center-screen. Mines were limited to 3.
