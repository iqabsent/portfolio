    With limited knowledge, and limited graphical capabilities, a game was
    written..<br />
    There was no internet access (I would only become acquainted with the WWW a
    year or so later); things were figured out. Knowledge of peers and teachers
    was drawn upon. Non-blocking key input (i.e., not readchar) was a key
    discovery (no pun intended). I also managed to figure out the logic of a game
    loop, years before I would learn the term.<br />
    <br />
    This was my first exploration of 2D coordinate space and collision detection.
    It was also my first attempt at AI. I learnt very quickly that a "perfect" AI
    was boring and frustrating.. that you had to build in flaws or randomness to
    make the game beatable.<br />
    I also learnt a bit about game dynamic here. The player who was "it" needed
    some advantage. Leaving the screen at one edge, saw the player enter from the
    edge opposite, pacman-style. This would allow for an infinite chase across
    screen-space, so the "it" player was made slightly faster.<br />
    Land-mines were also added .. the running player could place a pixel of its
    own colour at the press of a button. If the chasing player hit it, he would
    be spawned again at center-screen. Mines were limited to 3.

    At the very end of a 2-year course dealing purely with syntax and usage of
    several programming languages along with various database connectors, we were
    given the opportunity to write a database system .. or a 3D game. This second
    option would be wholly self-taught. We had, if memory serves, 5 weeks.<br />
    <br />
    The hardest part was the first two weeks' total lack of progress. It was an
    individual project; myself and one other candidate were the only ones to take
    up the challange. We combined research efforts until we found the DirectX SDK
    and the accompanying sample code as a starting point. He went FPS, I went
    flight-sim.<br />
    The end result was a 3D cube sky-box with a nice wrapping skyline and a
    textured floor (which tiles nicely, thanks 3D Studio Max) containing a .x model
    of an aircraft somewhere inside it. The craft position was fixed in x- and z-
    axes, but was free to move up and down on y. The illusion of movement is
    created by constantly adjusting the texture offset on the floor. Height is
    restricted by means of an engine-stall, and a crash at the bottom.<br />
    <br />
    This was my first encounter with 3D graphics. It also incorporates sound and
    UI elements. All sprites were created by myself using MS Paint.<br />
    I remember scratching my head about why 3.14 ("wait, that's pi!") rotated
    the reversed model to face the right direction, and not 180; first encounter
    with radians.

    During my first year of BSc study, I was given the opportunity to work on a
    small project for a company (then) based on campus at UEL. The inital project
    was simply a project management application, to manage files and links between
    them to ease the use of MicroStation, a CAD package in use by the architects in
    the studio. This then flowed over into development of Site Capacity, and an
    indefinite contract with them (which lasted 5 good years).<br />
    <br />
    Site Capacity is a tool used by the practice to aid in quick generation of
    urban layouts. I was fortunate enough to work on this with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=50908910">Renee Puusepp</a>.
    It involved programatic distribution of pre-created geometrical objects along
    user-defined paths. It also touched on Business Information Modeling (BIM),
    essentially just embedding meta-data into the geometry for better programatic
    management and evaluation of constructions.<br />
    <br />
    This project introduced me to agile develompent methods, extreme- and
    pair-programming. It was the first time I got to use an API to a 3D environemnt
    , and also the first time being paid to do coding.. happy.<br />
    You can read more of Site Capacity at <a href="http://www.sitecapacity.com/">http://www.sitecapacity.com/</a>
    Much thanks to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=335054">Frank Leonhardt</a> both a consultant to Slider, and lecturer at
    UEL, for the introduction to Slider, and the kick-off to my career.

    This delves into the use of agents within Google’s SketchUp, an entry level CAD
    package. It explores the extension of SketchUp functionality via the Ruby API.
    It seeks to allow users to turn components into intelligent objects, capable of
    reflecting user-defined personalities by means of distribution. It is a step
    towards having tables and chairs sort themselves into appropriate layouts,
    taking the mundane task of spatial distribution away from the architect. No
    agents were harmed during the development of this software.<br />
    <br />
    I hope to make the power of Agent available to the casual CAD user. The ideal
    outcome is to create a tool for Google SketchUp which allows the user to turn
    3D components into intelligent objects with relative ease. These objects
    should be capable of aligning, distancing and orientating themselves in
    relation to their peers according to behaviour sets specified by the user.
    The desired result is that these components can achieve a “good” distribution
    on their own.-

    One of the excercises carried out most often with Slider Studio, was the

    PHPFrame (our own) framework. Some of these were highly customisable,
    others more basic. Some were for clients, or as part of service packages;
    most were for internal use. I was lead developer on all website projects.

    I aided ENOISE, a regular Slider Studio collaborator, with the development of
    PHPFrame, a lightweight (but very capable) PHP framework. This framework
    enabled us to develop future web-applications much more rapidly. The website is
    no longer maintained, but the codebase is still in use and can be seen <a href="https://github.com/PHPFrame">here</a>.
    This project introduced me to MVC architecture, unit-tests, automated build
    systems, repository management systems and the PERL coding standard.

    The Drivers of Change project is driven by the foresight team of Arup, a large,
    multi-national company. They saw the need to manage an ever-growing database
    containing data gathered through events on the use an popularity (in voting) of
    what they refer to as Drivers of Change cards.
    We implemented a RESTful API to a slightly re-designed version of the existing
    database. It allowed for authentication to modify, and open read access to
    various resource endpoints. Data could be shifted in XML or JSON formats via
    HTTP requests. We used PHPFrame (Mashine plug-in) to develop this solution.
    Here I learnt about RESTful architecture and Public/Private key authentication
    algorithms (it gets complicated). This was also the first time I developed an
    entire software solution on my own. I learnt the value of knowing a project
    back-to-front, and the efficiency this brings to coding efforts. For this
    reason, this is probably the project I've enjoyed working on the most to date.
    While assisting in the use of the DoC API during the parrallel development of
    its first client application, I discovered the ease of development when the
    database layer has been separated out from the actual application entirely.

    TCAS is a case administration system I designed and developed as sole developer
    for Treethrope LTD. It's used by them to keep track of case details and ongoing
    case research. This web-based application is was built using PHPFrame over the
    course of 3 months. Here I was already able to estimate development time of
    features with fair accuracy, as I had experience in using PHPFrame with
    development of the DoC API. It was the first time I stepped through a full
    development cycle on this scale. Permissions, access levels and authorisation
    to access specific resources with rights to execute specific operations on
    these was a fun problem to have solved.Knowledge was gained in project
    management and client relations. I also did a lot of JavaScript optimisation
    and realised the difference in performance between jQuery and native JS code.

    We were given the assignment to produce either a demo showing integration with
    a middleware of our choosing (Box2D and Bullet being the most prominent options
    as these were covered during the course) or write a useful tool. I dug in for
    the latter.<br />
    <br />
    During lectures there was mention of "impostors" or "sprites" as I know them.
    These are still used today in games as a means of saving resources when drawing
    distant objects (instead of 3D models) where you can get away with low detail.
    I remembered rotating a QuakeII quad-damage model at 30 degree angle steps and
    making screen-shots to assemble them into an animated windows cursor, for
    personal use back in school, and thought a tool do do this kind of thing for
    you would be useful, thus: Impostorisor was born.<br />
    <br />
    The Tool takes as input a 3D model in .geom format (<a href="http://andythomason.com/">Andy Thomason</a>'s work) and
    spits out a single image with a grid of frames at stepped angle rotations of
    the input model against a black background.
    This project saw me step into the world of OpenGL (similar to DirectX, so not
    totally new) and re-aquainted with my good friend C++. It looked diferent after
    years of PHP and JavaScript.

    The name, "AltitudeZero", is a play on fact that the game is written using 3D

    all game-objects to 0.
