  Tag game (2001)
  Turbo Pascal
  Secondary Education, Computer Studies Project
  <img "images/triangle-tag.jpg" />
  <details>
  With limited knowledge, and limited graphical capabilities, a game was
  written..
  There was no internet access (I would only become acquainted with the WWW a
  year or so later); things were figured out. Knowledge of peers and teachers
  was drawn upon. Non-blocking key input (i.e., not readchar) was a key
  discovery (no pun intended). I also managed to figure out the logic of a game
  loop, years before I would learn the term.
  This was my first exploration of 2D coordinate space and collision detection.
  It was also my first attempt at AI. I learnt very quickly that a "perfect" AI
  was boring and frustrating.. that you had to build in flaws or randomness to
  make the game beatable.
  I also learnt a bit about game dynamic here. The player who was "it" needed
  some advantage. Leaving the screen at one edge, saw the player enter from the
  edge opposite, pacman-style. This would allow for an infinite chase across
  screen-space, so the "it" player was made slightly faster.
  Land-mines were also added .. the running player could place a pixel of its
  own colour at the press of a button. If the chasing player hit it, he would
  be spawned again at center-screen. Mines were limited to 3.

3D Game (2003)
DirectX 7 SDK, C++
Systems Development, Final Project
<details>
At the very end of a 2-year course, dealing purely with syntax and usage of
several programming languages along with various database connectors, we were
given the opportunity to write a database system .. or a 3D game. This second
option would be wholly self-taught. We had, if memory serves, 5 weeks.
The hardest part was the first two weeks' total lack of progress. It was an
individual project; myself and one other candidate were the only ones to take
up the challange. We combined research efforts until we found the DirectX SDK
and the accompanying sample code as a starting point. He went FPS, I went
flight-sim.
The end result was a 3D cube sky-box with a nice wrapping skyline and a
textured floor (which tiles nicely, thanks 3D Studio Max) containing a .x model
of an aircraft somewhere inside it. The craft position was fixed in x- and z-
axes, but was free to move up and down on y. The illusion of movement is
created by constantly adjusting the texture offset on the floor. Height is
restricted by means of an engine-stall, and a crash at the bottom.
This was my first encounter with 3D graphics. It also incorporates sound and
UI elements. All sprites were created by myself using MS Paint.
I remember scratching my head about why 3.14 ("wait, that's pi!") rotated
the reversed model to face the right direction, and not 180; first encounter
with radians.

Site Capacity (2007)
MicroStation MX, VBA
Slider Studio Ltd, R&D project and service tool
<details>
During my first year of BSc study, I was given the opportunity to work on a
small project for a company (then) based on campus at UEL. The inital project
was simply a project management application, to manage files and links between
them to ease the use of MicroStation, a CAD package in use by the architects in
the studio. This then flowed over into development of Site Capacity, and an
indefinite contract with them (which lasted 5 good years).
Site Capacity is a tool used by the practice to aid in quick generation of
urban layouts. I was fortunate enough to work on this with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=50908910">Renee Puusepp</a>.
It involved programatic distribution of pre-created geometrical objects along
user-defined paths. It also touched on Business Information Modeling (BIM),
essentially jsut embedding meta-data into the geometry for better programatic
management and evaluation of constructions.
This project introduced me to agile develompent methods, extreme- and
pair-programming. It was the first time I got to use an API to a 3D environemnt
, and also the first time being paid to do coding.. happy.
You can read more of Site Capacity at <a href="http://www.sitecapacity.com/">http://www.sitecapacity.com/</a>
Much thanks to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=335054">Frank Leonhardt</a> both a consultant to Slider, and lecturer at
UEL, for the introduction to Slider, and the kick-off to my career.

Slider Projects (2007 - 2012)
YouCanPlan 3D, StickyWorld, PHPFrame, DoC API, TCAS, Joomla!, WordPress
Java, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript
<details>
During my time with Slider Studio, I've worked on many projects of varying
nature. I'll go over a few of them here.

Web development
The majority of projects were development of website templates using either the
Joomla! or WordPress frameworks; some highly customisable, for clients and some
more basic for internal use.

PHPFrame
I aided ENOISE, a regular Slider Studio collaborator, with the development of
PHPFrame, a lightweight (but very capable) PHP framework. This framework
enabled us to develop future web-applications much more rapidly. The website is
no longer maintained, but the codebase is still in use and can be seen <a href="https://github.com/PHPFrame">here</a>.
This project introduced me to MVC architecture, unit-tests, automated build
systems, repository management systems and the PERL coding standard.

Drivers of Change (DoC) API
http://api.driversofchange.com/api/
http://www.driversofchange.com/make/research/doc/
The Drivers of Change project is driven by the foresight team of Arup, a large,
multi-national company. They saw the need to manage an ever-growing database
containing data gathered through events on the use an popularity (in voting) of
what they refer to as Drivers of Change cards.
We implemented a RESTful API to a slightly re-designed version of the existing
database. It allowed for authentication to modify, and open read access to
various resource endpoints. Data could be shifted in XML or JSON formats via
HTTP requests. We used PHPFrame (Mashine plug-in) to develop this solution.
Here I learnt about RESTful architecture and Public/Private key authentication
algorithms (it gets complicated). This was also the first time I developed an
entire software solution on my own. I learnt the value of knowing a project
back-to-front, and the efficiency this brings to coding efforts. For this
reason, this is probably the project I've enjoyed working on the most to date.
While assisting in the use of the DoC API during the parrallel development of
its first client application, I discovered the ease of development when the
database layer has been separated out from the actual application entirely.

Treethorpe Case Administration System (TCAS)
http://www.treethorpe.com/
TCAS is a case administration system I designed and developed as sole developer
for Treethrope LTD. It's used by them to keep track of case details and ongoing
case research. This web-based application is was built using PHPFrame over the
course of 3 months. Here I was already able to estimate development time of
features with fair accuracy, as I had experience in using PHPFrame with
development of the DoC API. It was the first time I stepped through a full
development cycle on this scale. Permissions, access levels and authorisation
to access specific resources with rights to execute specific operations on
these was a fun problem to have solved.Knowledge was gained in project
management and client relations.

Impostoriser (2012)
Tools and Middleware (assignment)
C++, OpenGL
<details>
We were given the assignment to produce either a demo showing integration with
a middleware of our choosing (Box2D and Bullet being the most prominent options
as these were covered during the course) or write a useful tool. I dug in for
the latter.
During lectures there was mention of "impostors" or "sprites" as I know them.
These are still used today in games as a means of saving resources when drawing
distan objects (instead of 3D models) where you can get away with low detail.
I remembered rotating a QuakeII quad-damage model at 30 degree angle steps and
making screen-shots to assemble them into an animated windows cursor, for
personal use back in school, and thought a tool do do this kind of thing for
you would be useful, thus: Impostorisor was born.
The Tool takes as input a 3D model in .geom format (<a href="http://andythomason.com/">Andy Thomason</a>'s work) and
spits out a single image with a grid of frames at stepped angle rotations of
the input model against a black background.
This project saw me step into the world of OpenGL (similar to DirectX, so not
totally new) and re-aquainted with my good friend C++. It looked diferent after
years of PHP and JavaScript.

AltitudeZero - A 2D Game (2012)
Introduction to Game Programming (assignment)
<a href="https://github.com/iqabsent/MScCGE-gp-2012">https://github.com/iqabsent/MScCGE-gp-2012</a>
C++, OpenGL
<details>
"Write a 2D game using OpenGL and C++"; this was fun. Having had my head re-
wrapped around OpenGL and C++, I set out to make a classic, top-down, space
shooter scroller game.
There isn't much to say about it, but I'm quite happy with what I was able to
accomplish in a very short space of time (~1 week while working part-time and
attending Uni). The code can be seen on my github account as linked to above.
The name, "AltitudeZero", is a play on fact that the game is written using 3D
techniques, but simply sets the depth (height from the game perspective) for
all game-objects to 0.

L-System (2012)
<a href="https://github.com/iqabsent/MScCGE-mg-2012">https://github.com/iqabsent/MScCGE-mg-2012</a>
Maths and Graphics (assignment)
C++, DirectX 9, RTVS
<details>
An L-System. (If you don't already know what that is, you probably don't need
to) .. that said, this program draws lines based on text in config files,
by using a string to start, and doing recursive string replacement according to
rules specified, and then interpreting each character in the resulting string
as a "command": move and draw, rotate, start branch and end branch .. more or
less.
It works and the code for it can also be seen on my github account.
We were asked to use C++, DirectX 9 and a library called RTVS which I re-wrote
into a unity build.

Terrain Generation (2013)
Maths and Graphics (Assignment, Group)
C++, OpenGL
<details>
A quick demonstration of terrain generation using an implimentation of Perlin
noise. This done in collaboration with <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/wmasek">Will Masek</a>.
We were team Will (him #1, I was #0; I then I started using my real name which
solved a lot of problems).
Will focussed on a DirectX framework for use in this and future projects, as
well as the generation of a vertex mesh. He then exposed a function by which
this mesh could be generated using an array of input values for heights, and
rendered as a triangle-strip with texture(s) wrapped over the top.
I, Willem, set out to develop an implimentation of the Perlin Noise algorithm
to feed height values to this function in order to generate viable terrain.
