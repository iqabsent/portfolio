      <h4>Story</h4>
      I'm Willem. Hi.
      <br /><br />
      It's pronounced the same as Villain, with an 'm' instead of an 'n' at the
	  end. This has no bearing on my character alignment..

      I grew up in Breerivier in the Western Cape of South Africa, known to
	  tourists as the wine route; ~50 miles of vineyards and grapes. Grapes
	  aren't very social; as a child I failed to appreciate the isolation and
	  quiet beauty of the place. I spent much of my free time (in between
	  chores and more studies than I could care for) playing with the dog,
	  swinging sticks around like a ninja, or mountain-biking all over the
	  place.. but most of my time was consumed by my indulgence in computer
	  games.

      Studies after school naturally leaned towards the field of computing.
	  Software Engineering seemed the most obvious challenge to take on, and
	  also the most direct path to making games. Once two years of studies were
	  done and dusted, I realised that the state of the game development
	  industry in SA left a lot to the imagination. This and a late-teen
	  rebellion at the age of 20 saw me board a plane to the UK in search of
	  greener pastures.
      <!-- <br /><br />
      I was not offered a game-development job when getting off the plane at Heathrow
      .. I saw this as a minor set-back. Since then I've been playing this card-game
      with the UKBA. They call it visa. The rules are, I need to have one, or leave.
      It's been 8 and a half years and I've currently got a good hand.. it has taken
      a lot of hard work and dedication thus far. That and the help of several good
      people. -->
      <br /><br />
      After the initial two years of saving up, I enrolled for BSc studies.
	  During my first year at UeL, I pestered one of the best
      <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=335054" title="Frank Leonhardt">
      lecturers</a> I've ever had for more challenging problems to solve, as
	  the assignments we were assigned (given my previous studies) were not.
	  The pestering somehow led to an introduction to Slider Studio where I
	  found myself working as a Software Engineer for 5 years.
      <br /><br />
      Slider Studio was a small architectural practice looking to push adoption
	  of modern-day computing techniques and technologies in the field of
	  architecture. During my time with Slider, I was tasked with assisting
	  ENOISE in the development of a PHP framework which we then used for
	  in-house development of web-applications.
      <br /><br />
      When my focus shifted back to studies on the MSc course, there was a
	  mutual agreement between Slider and ENOISE that my availability would
	  better match the working environment ENOISE could offer, and I joined the
	  ranks of ENOISE. I worked remotely in between lectures and coursework
	  assignments from wherever my laptop and I happened to be at the time; it
	  was glorious.

      <h4>Aim</h4>
      The aim is simple: spend some years making computer games. I can see myself
      working on gameplay scripting and AI more than anything else. I enjoy playing
      with rendering and shaders. I get some gratification from hours (if not days)
      of research and refactoring code to get that extra x% of performance out of it.
      I also enjoy building entire "eco-systems" from scratch and watch lots of
      intricate bits of code play nice together. That said, AI and gameplay remain
      the main attraction. I am intrigued by human-computer interaction, and also the
      effect it has on the human psyche. Escapism is something I have first-hand
      experience with; this and simply how humans think fascinate me. I hope to
      explore this field further someday, but first .. game making.

      <h4>Getting There</h4>
      I can see the immense value in working as part of a team for an established
      game development studio. An internship where I can learn and experience game
      development first-hand would be ideal. I also believe that I would be very
      valuable to anyone willing to offer me such a position. It seems to be the
      logical follow-on from the MSc studies.

      Due to the ongoing UKBA card-game, however, I have to be extremely careful
      with my footing. I'd be hard pressed to give up the sponsorship route
      currently available to me via ENOISE. Additionally, -->
    <div class="span12">
      <br />
      While studying, I'm also working part-time for ENOISE, a web host and developer.
      
      ENOISE pushes the envelope
      on web development and has adopted JavaScript, both server-side and client-side
      as primary medium. We rely heavily on automation, test-driven development (to
      largely automate QA) and automated build systems. We follow best practice (when
      not defining it) and code for performance. We're accustomed to coding to the
      PERL coding standard when we need to .. a pain to get used to, but results in
      very high quality code. All this means that I have much to learn here, and am
      in a position to explore and push the boundaries of JS which shows more and
      more potential the better you get to know it. When you take a step back and
      look at the shift towards mobile gaming this is perhaps a perfect place for me
      to be right now. There is also the remote working perk; incredibly hard to beat
      as I intend to travel <!--once the card-game is over..--> in the not so distant future..

      <h4>Hobbies & Interests</h4>
      In between full-time studies and working part-time (which doesn't leave much
      over), I enjoy bouldering/rock-climbing for working off the excess physical
      energy which doesn't seem to go anywhere while coding. I recently stopped
      dancing salsa, which there is thankfully no footage of.. this one of a few 
      regular attempts to push boundaries beyond my own comfort-zone. Ice-skating
      went better..

      I also attend some meetups which relate closely to my coding interests and
      then some others, like the MCM (Movie Comic Media) Expo, which don't .. but
      there I get to be a hero for a weekend every 6 months or so. ..or a villain;
      I don't fear the dark side.. they usually have some games on pre-release demo
      there as well.

      Up until now, whenever I got a break and financial demands allowed it, I
	  holiday time in South Africa with family and friends.. and sun and
	  animals and open spaces. ..and sun.
	  <br />
	  Going forward, I'll likely start travelling the world and start ticking
	  places off my bucket-list iteniary.

      Ever since my first through-the-night session with NES games, I've been
      traversing the gaming scene throughout the years, mostly getting stuck on
      RTS, FPS and RPG titles. I'm an avid PC gamer, and leave consoles for racing
      and beat-em-up titles (simply can't aim with thumbs, sorry). Most recently,
	  Fallout 4 claimed almost 3 weeks of my life. War .. war never changes.
