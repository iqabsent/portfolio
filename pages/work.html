    <h5>Construction</h5>

      Not relevant to career path, but mentioned since it had a significant impact
      on who I am. Working as construction site labour is arguably one of the best
      jobs I've had. It also helped with funding further, relevant studies as an
      "overseas" student within the UK (~Â£39k to date)<br />
      Working as in-house security at the flagship M&S branch, I was often left in
      charge of real-time coordination of a small team (up to 8) on several time-critical
      operations where clear and concise communication was key.

      Spent a harvest season making wine with my father. Got to know him and the
      trade I grew up with. A great experience and funded my little trip to the UK.
